# Joker's Burger - Hamburger Shop

Welcome to the Joker's Burger project, a Brazilian hamburger shop web application built with JS, HTML, CSS, and React (Vite).
The project includes a menu page with an accordion list, a contact page, and a home page. The Google Maps API is integrated to display the shop's location.
